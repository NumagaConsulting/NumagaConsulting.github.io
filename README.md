## Setup

Going off platform: You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest VSCode) and
[Git version control](https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9). If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for
version control,
[review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-git-and-github-part-i/modules/fecp-introduction-to-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-generalizations)
or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have
[Node set up locally](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) to be able to run your script.

## Code Examples

Show examples of usage:

1. open your terminal and pull the source code of this project by git

   `git clone https://github.com/NumagaConsulting/Codeacademy/tree/feature/mixed-message`

2. You have to [install node and local environment](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) to make the following step work as
   it's exptected.
3. open up terminal and go to the project directory
4. run the main.js to initilize the node server

   `node main.js`

5. your terminal should return 'Server is running on http://localhost:8000'`

6. you are good to go to index.html to check out the qutoes of the day.
